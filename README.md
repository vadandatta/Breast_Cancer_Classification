# Breast Cancer Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CancerNet)

This project implements a deep learning model to classify breast cancer histopathology images as either benign or malignant. The model is trained on high-resolution microscopy images using a Convolutional Neural Network architecture (CancerNet) tailored for binary classification.

---

##  Objective

To assist pathologists by automating the detection of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in breast tissue slides through image classification, thereby enhancing early diagnosis and treatment planning.
